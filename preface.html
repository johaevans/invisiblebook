<p align="left"><em>Secrets</em> is a book that came to me when I was ready for it&#8212;but not one minute sooner.</p>
<p align="left">
    In bookmaking, there is always a struggle to fit the concept, the design and the content together. There was no such struggle with <em>Secrets</em>; it flowed painlessly from day one.</p>
<p align="left">    <em>Secrets</em> began as a result of my unwillingness to write in a pristine and empty book I had just made. Its pages were beautiful in their blankness&#8212;leaving pencil marks would violate them.</p>
<p align="left"> How to resolve this conflict? The answer was literally clear: invisible writing! I slept on the thought. By the next morning it was obvious to me that the only content worthy of the book and the concealed ink would be words that could not be said out loud.</p>
<p align="left"> It really amazes me that complete strangers were willing to come to my website and share with me those episodes in their lives they do not (and perhaps would rather not) talk about. I feel extremely honored to have offered the chance for others to expose their sorrows, faux pas, and personal struggles. I hope that there has been some relief in the telling for those who bared their soul.</p>
<p align="left"> Where am I going with this project? Good question&#8230; My deep involvement with it, joy while working on it, and strong desire to complete it  all tells me that I should go further. I envision several books following the same process with topics that people would be uncomfortable talking about face to face. Fantasies&#8230; Fears&#8230; Dreams&#8230; Unseemly Desires&#8230;</p>
<p align="left"> I may turn once again to the web to ask you all the topic of the next book we make together&#8230;</p>
