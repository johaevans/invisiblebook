My apology is to time and how fast it goes. Whirling straight across the horizon into oblivion\'s breast.
But for now my thoughts are to the first painters I ever met, my mother and my grandmother. Their work inspired me and led me to their path, paint. No matter what, they meant the world to me, always have and always will. The ones that will be with me forever, watching over me, seeing my way is as straight as I can make it. Straight back to their hearts. The lines of time they addressed are with me like a small journal stuffed in my pocket. There for the times I need them, safe and sound in the thought of their lives and their compassion and wisdom. Others for the moments when it is time to throw caution to the wind and adventure the mercurial path of life. They showed me time and they showed me how to use it.
The very thought of time\'s hold on us is monumental. What we do with it and what we never do. I have tried to take time as a companion, make the most of it and when it it is lost or stolen or wasted, I merely smile and think of those two great gals that led me to this plain of beauty called life.
My apology is to time and their missing so much of it, the times they both treasured. Never have I known two greater ladies that made he most of time and its existence. 
My apology is to missing them, yet they live on in me and my work and life. No apology to that, just a thought of how better the world would be with their grace upon this twirling marble in the glittering spiraling star lit Universe.

My apology is to time and memory. And how i will use it and remember.
