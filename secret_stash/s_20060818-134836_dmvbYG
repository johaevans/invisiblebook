Mom, you were right there in front of me, dying for two years. right there. and I went on like nothing had changed. like you weren\'t there. I think once I told you that I thought you were strong. but in two years you deserved more. I am sad that I can\'t say it now, but I am sorry that I didn\'t say it then.
