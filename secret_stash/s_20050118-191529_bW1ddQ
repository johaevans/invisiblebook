I live with the Noonday Demon; I have severe depression.  My family, co-workers, and friends do not know that I go to psychiatrists and psychologists to keep my sorry, sad soul on this planet.  No one knows that I had a failed suicide attempt, not even the doctors.  I show up at work every day and do a decent job.  I hob-knob with co-workers.  I shower every day, I keep my home clean, and I smile back to those who smile first, but just under the surface, while I\'m smiling and cleaning and helping people at work, I want to end it all.
