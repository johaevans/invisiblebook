I lost my virginity in high school, and thats when sex became an adventure.  My boyfriend at the time worked at the local Jr. College, and had the keys to all of the rooms in the building.  We did it on the grand piano in the concert hall, in the box office of the theater, in the science lab for all the specimens in jars to see...It was scary, because we could have been caught a few times.  The thrill of stupidity dissipated when I started lactaing two/three months later.  My parents found out I was pregnant,& wasn\'t going to keep the baby. They bestowed to me a set of suitcases, and took my sister to Disneyland.  I moved out on my 18th birthday.
