Grandma,

You were lonely, you were sorry, and you were sick.  I was young, I was selfish, and I was naive.  I\'m so sorry I didn\'t try to get to know you better.  I\'m so sorry that I didn\'t find a way to have you come live with me where you could be more comfortable and could drown me with those wet kisses more often.

I\'m so sorry, I didn\'t teach myself how to know you.  I\'m sorry I didn\'t understand your importance in my life...until it was too late.
