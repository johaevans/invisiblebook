I have always loved my first love and will always love this man and I sent him away!!!  We were high school sweethearts and I left him for whatever. He married someone else because he had to, got divorced, never remarried, and is alone today.  I married a wonderful man who I don\'t love.  He loves me and I feel so guilty not returning his feelings.  We never had kids as it never felt \"right\".   I lie in bed next to him and dream about another man and have for over 25 years.   I am spending my life in a world of dreams - what a complete waste!!  Even my dearest friends don\'t know - they think we are the happiest couple!!  Never settle for second best!!  Don\'t do it if it\'s not the right one!!  Mark, I will  love you  through eternity!!!
