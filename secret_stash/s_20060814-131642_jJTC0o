I am sorry that drinking and drugs were more important to me than you.  I am sorry for the debt and for the destruction.  I can never express how sorry I am for the lies and secrets.  I am so sorry that I was unable to live up to your expectations, and that I disapointed you again and again.

I am so grateful that you have been able to forgive me - if not forget.  I am forever indebt to you, your support and your love.  I could not have been healed without you... my family.

love always -SS
