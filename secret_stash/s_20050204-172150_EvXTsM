Where do I begin? My secret is...well, still a secret until now maybe. I am madly inlove with my girlfriend. Every day I think on what it would be like to marry her, to have children and live with her ther rest of my days. I want to love only one woman for the rest of my life. I want it to be her. Before her I dated a gal who dated Jonny Depp and was in Playboy. She was hot but nothing compared to the lovely soul of my Christina. She is much hotter because she is sincere,  a more lovely woman I have never had the pleasure of giving pleasure too. She could easily be my universe, my reason for being, my last breath should be with her. My every morning. She is as lovely as anything the stars could form and better still than water to my thisty soul. My secret cannot be a secret for ever. Not when it is love, Love cannot be contained can it?
