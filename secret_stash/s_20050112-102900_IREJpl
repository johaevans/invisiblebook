I am happy being celibate and single after 21 years in a relationship with an alcoholic who abused me emotionally and sexually. I tell my friends I am open to another relationship but the reality is that I feel a lovely sense of freedom and contentedness with coming home to a quiet house, making a cup of tea, and sitting with a cat on my lap and a book in my hand while listening to music I like and having dinner when I feel like it.
