Type your secret here
   growing up my mom had strange boyfriends. She dated a blind guy on the third floor of one of the apartment blocks. She kept a key to his place. I would sneak the key from her purse and go into his apartment when they went on dates. I found photo collections of his ex-wife naked.And jars of coins.I stole a lot of his coins and spent them on matchbox cars and candy.
