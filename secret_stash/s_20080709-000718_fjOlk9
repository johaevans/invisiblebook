I am so sorry I was young and stupid. I was so wrapped up in my own insecurities that I never really listened to you. I knew I loved you but was to inmature to do the right thing. I was so scared and happy when you said you loved me, but part of me couldn\'t believe you actually did. Then I acted so so so stupid running after you. Now that I am older I wish I could have one more minute to say I\'m sorry, I am so sorry I should have been there. I should have been real. This is the only way to say sorry because you died and I can only hope one day I will see you again.
