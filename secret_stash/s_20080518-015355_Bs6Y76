Daniel,
I\'m sorry for the times that I played with your heart. I know you won\'t ever believe me, and I know I\'ll never get you back. I was and still am just a confused lonely girl, who is afraid of making the wrong choices. But I see now I made the biggest mistake already by letting you to. I\'m sorry.
