Even though you don\'t know that I have, I\'m sorry for giving up on our marriage in my heart. I think we were meant to be just good friends, but now that we\'re together I can\'t just say goodbye. You have nowhere to turn and I don\'t want to start over. Nor do I want to be without you. It\'s complicated and it\'s something I\'ve never admitted to anyone before. I\'ll try hard to make the rest of your life all you hoped it would be with me.
