That last woman I was fucking never knew that I couldn\'t stand her. She was beautiful and successful, cultured and alurring; a balerina in Paris, London, S.F. etc. She made money and did well but I could care less. I was fucking her becasue she loved it and it was fun to thrill her. She was Pam Andersons\' stunt double and in Playboy.She loved money. Maybe I am as shallow as her? That scared me. So I quitfucking her and started calling the police on her for having parties during the week. She was a total alchohalic loser. I began to hate her. She made me sick. Not because she was a drunk all though that was part of it. Mostly because and artist so talented should never sink so low as to become a drunk who hooks her men through cocaine and sex. It was fun but I hated her and she made me hate myself for that too.
