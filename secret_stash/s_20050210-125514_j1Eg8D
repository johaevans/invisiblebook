Type your secret here

I have been with my boyfriend for a long time (several years).  I\'ve never had an orgasm during sex with him, even though he thinks I have one every time (I fake it). I don\'t think I can ever tell him because he\'d hate me for lying to him and probably never trust me again. Besides, since i\'ve never had an orgasm during sex, I figure the problem isn\'t him, it\'s me.
