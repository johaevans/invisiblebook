To Danny

I\'m sorry I never called. I\'m sorry I spent those six months distracted with the small things in life that I took no notice of you. In retrospect, it all seems so frivolous now. I can\'t even remember what was so important that I didn\'t pick up the phone. All I can remember is that I will never get those opportunities back and now it\'s too late. Too late to call, too late to visit, too late to give you a hug or a kiss. It\'s too late. I flitted it away. I\'m sorry I never said goodbye and will never get a chance to. You\'re nowhere now. Gone. 

Without warning. 

I love you always.
