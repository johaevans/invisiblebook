When I was a girl I had a horrible habit of telling lies in order to hide my pain. I was so jealous that you were dancing en pointe and I wasn\'t. I wasn\'t because I was too fat. I knew it and you knew it. 

So instead, I lied to you and said I was finally en pointe. You found out and confronted me. We never talked again. You know what? I screwed up and I missed our friendship. 

Now that we\'ve grown up, I see what an amazing person you\'ve become. If we knew each other today, almost 20 years later, we would probably be really good friends. But I doubt you would ever talk to me because I lied to you when I was a self-conscious kid. 

I\'m sorry I lied. And I\'m sorry I never had the guts to make amends. And I\'m even sorrier that we will probably never get to know each other as adults.
