When I was 14, my mother was diagnosed with brain cancer. By the time I was 15, she was in a hospice center with only a few months left. My mom died a month before I turned 16, and as I approach my 19th birthday, I want to apologize for the time when I was a little girl, and I refused to go to the grocery store with her because I was embarrassed about what she was wearing. If I’d realized at the time that she wouldn\'t be around forever, and how much I would miss her once she was gone, I would have gone to the grocery store with her. I’m so sorry mom, for not spending every minute I could have with you, when I still had the chance.
