Mom, you know all of those times I cut myself or tried to hurt myself? I did those things not only to relieve my pain but to inflict it on you. I knew by hurting myself, I hurt you more. 

While I\'m still trying to get over many of the horrible things you said to me throughout my life, I do know it wasn\'t worth it to torture you like that. I\'m going to be the grownup -- the adult. I\'m sorry for hurting you so deeply and so selfishly.
