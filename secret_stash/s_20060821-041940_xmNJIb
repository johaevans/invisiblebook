I\'m so sorry I didn\'t come and see you, that I didn\'t even call.  The last I heard you were married and happy--now I know that the wife betrayed you just as the cancer was slowly claiming your earthly body. 

Your death wasn\'t as much of a shock as the realization that the last time I saw you was at a funeral almost six years prior--and that I will never see you again.  

Your picture is by my bed.  I talk to you now. All the unfinished conversations run through my mind and I cry. 

I\'m so sorry Patrick.  I love you.
