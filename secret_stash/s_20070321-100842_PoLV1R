To mom and dad

Living in a war torn country, my childhood dream was to go to a university in the UK. My parents would tell me that they would miss me too much, that it would kill them. I secretly hated them for it. When I graduated and got  a scholarship to a university in London, it was the happiest moment of my life. It was the saddest of theirs, my mother cried for days on end and still cries today, 15 years on. My father lost the sparkle in his eyes and dropped his head in sorrow. They both seemed to have aged in just a few minutes. The pain in their faces was almost tangible. I did not get it then. I thought they were selfish. 

Now I am a mother myself and still living in London, I cannot visit my parents because of the war in Lebanon and ironically that is the only wish I now have, to go back home. 

How I wish I could look in their faces and tell them I should have never left them. Tell them how I cry myself to sleep every night, how the sad look on their faces haunts my every dream, how I am so scared I never will see them again, how stupid I had been not to have seen their pain…I wish I can turn back the clock and take all their hurt away. I wish I could only tell them how truly sorry I am and I how I get it now, I understand…Emmeh Samira and bayyeh Maurice I love you so much and I am so very sorry!
