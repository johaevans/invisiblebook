Type your apology here

You were my dearest friend for so long. During those many angst-filled years, you were my rock. We promised we\'d be friends forever. 

I\'m sorry I haven\'t called. So much time has now passed that I don\'t even know where to start. Your illness scared me. I\'m scared you\'re not the same person you were -- and I don\'t know how to handle that. 

I pray some day I\'ll find my way back to you.
