Years ago I was riding my motorcycle down to LA with a couple of other guys. It was hot as hell on Hwy 5. We decided it would be funny as hell to ride naked except for boots and a helmet. Well it was pretty funny, we got a lot of great looks and thumbs up, only the CHP in king city didn\'t think it was funny. They arrested us for indecent exposier. We were all married guys and we made a pact not to ever tell our wives, so we had to lie when we went to court and paid fines. I lie about it when I am asked on an application if I have ever been arrested.
