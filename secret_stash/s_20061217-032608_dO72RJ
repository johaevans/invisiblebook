To Tarhyn,

Please forgive me for shunning you, it\'s only a showing of my deep love for your beauty, grace and intelligence. I can see the pain on your face when I turn my back on you, and now the power of my pride denies me of giving you a proper apology. It\'s amazing that you still love me, and support me even after all of the hell I\'ve put you through. That is true love, and you shall be rewarded in due time. In all regards, you\'re perfect, and I wish that I could say I\'m sorry but I\'m ashamed to look at you now.

Your Sincere Love,
Lucas
