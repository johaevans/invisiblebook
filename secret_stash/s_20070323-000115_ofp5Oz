I am sorry for not having been able to be what you wanted me to be. Still, in what I was to you I succeeded better than in being a friend, a daughter, a sister, a wife to other people.
I am sorry for loving you with all my heart when what you felt for me was not love, but lust...
I am sorry for how fast you will forget me when I will still be in love with you...
I am sorry for the 3 years and a half that I spent dreaming of someone who will never need me... I am sorry knowing that I will never be able to forget you.
