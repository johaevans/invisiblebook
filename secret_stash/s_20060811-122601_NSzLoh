For the past.  For my unfaithful youthful choices.  For trying to hold onto something that we both knew had withered long ago.  For holding back tears when you left until after you were just out of sight.  For letting too much time pass until I could forgive myself.  For never having the courage to look you in the eyes since.

I\'m sorry.
