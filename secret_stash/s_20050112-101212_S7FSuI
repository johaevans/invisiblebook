Did you know that I once took your toothbrush and cleaned the dog\'s teeth with it when I was mad at you? I also fast forwarded through those movies you wanted me to return to the Video Barn so you would have to pay the fee for not rewinding. I also took all your mints so you would not have enough for that big job interview. Why did I do all of these petty things? Because you forgot my birthday. You would think a mother wouldn\'t forget that type of thing.
