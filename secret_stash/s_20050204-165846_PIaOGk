Once I had worked for a bank, and every bank teller has a cash can limit of $15,000.00. Another teller who was over her limit had to sell me some of her money so she could balance. This girl was rude and obnoxious, and didn\'t pay attention to what she gave me which was $500.00 more than she should. Discreetly, I slipped that money into my purse. When she tried to balance, she couldn\'t and got fired. I never got caught and had a great time spending the money!
