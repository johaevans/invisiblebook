im a thief.  i began really stealing when i was 16.  some of my mentors were amazing thieves (one would steal wigs off of window shop manniquins standing in shop windows).  i stole from jobs- i stole wine, champange, money, food.  everywhere i go i want to steal things; at parties i steal stuff out of medicine cabinets or hallways.  i am a kleptomaniac and i enjoy it.
