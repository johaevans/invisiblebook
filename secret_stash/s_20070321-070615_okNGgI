I’m sorry to the old Dr. Martin shoeseller in Hampton Hill, Greater London, for not returning to pay him the one pound outstanding on a pair of boots he sold me and let me take when I was short of cash. He said, “I trust you’ll come back and pay, you look like an honest girl, so you can take them now.” I was 16 years old at the time and fully intended to repay him only each time I was about to set off it rained. The cycle ride was uphill all the way to the shop from where I lived and I just got really lazy as teenagers do. That was back in 1986 so I’m not sure he’s still alive and if he is, I hope he’s forgotten.
