I\'m sorry I did not believe in you. All you asked for was a touch of faith, a sign of support, a glimmer of recognition that anything is possible when backed by passion and dedication. I let you down... by not believing, I pricked the tiniest hole in your balloon of belief and hope, making it that much harder to float.

I hope you have filled that patch and you are now soaring to the sun. I believe.
