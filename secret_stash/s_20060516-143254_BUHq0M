Sometimes I read your letters.

Because you\'ve lied to me before, and it\'s endangered your lifeâ€¦ and I want to make sure you\'re okay.

And I don\'t know what\'s worse: my breach of trust by invading your privacy or your breach of trust by writing more lies. About us, about me and about your terrible problem.

But I\'m sorry.
