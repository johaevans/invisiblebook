i\'ve been an \"out\" lesbian for 10 years now.  only in the past two years have i been able to admit to myself that i enjoy sleeping with men.  (especially while i\'m ovulating).  i am currently involved with a woman and am afraid to take action and actually sleep with men.  this sitation causes me alot of frustration.
