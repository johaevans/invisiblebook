I\'m waiting for the day that I walk in and you don\'t recognize me anymore.  I keep thinking that will be a terrible day, but maybe I\'m wrong.  Maybe that\'s the day I know your suffering is done.  I know that you are frustrated now.  Believe me, we are too.  I don\'t have the patience for the same stories over and over.  I hope that some small part somewhere in your damaged mind  knows that we remember who you used to be and that is why it is so difficult to make the decisions we are forced into now.  I am sorry that you feel trapped.  I can only imagine what life must be like when you can no longer trust yourself.  I am sorry that you blame us.  We made a promise to Dad that we would take care of you and we intend to do just that.  I am sorry that you want to die.  I can\'t say that I would want it differently if it were me.  I\'m sorry that you are so combative.  It is so difficult to take care of you now.  I am sorry that I didn\'t say goodbye.  The worst part it all is that we never got a chance to realize you were gone.  When you sit and speak to us now, I shake my head and think \"God, how did it get to this...?\"   

It\'s time for you pills; and I\'m sorry.  I know you don\'t like to take them.
