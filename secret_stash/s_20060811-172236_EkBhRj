A few years ago I figured out a way to steal from the company i worked for and never get caught. I stole enough to just help me get by in my bills and i returned some of it. A few months later I quit the job and the person that replaced me was fired a few weeks later for theft. I dont know if it was from what I stole or if she was actually stealing.
