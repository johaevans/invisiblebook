I\'m so sorry I gave you up.  I didn\'t have many options and listened to what everyone around me thought I should do.  I think about you daily and cry.  Did I disappoint?  Did I hurt you?  Do you look back and think how horrible I am?  I pray you don\'t. I pray that you know that I didn\'t know any better and that if I could take it back, I would in a second.  Please forgive me.
