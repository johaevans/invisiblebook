I\'ve never told anyone about this because I\'m so embarassed of my stupidity. When I was younger and living in my first apartment, I got one of those things in the mail saying I won something and just had to call some phone number. I called the number and was told I had one several prizes and had a chance to win a huge prize of money. All I had to do to collect my prizes and be eligible for the big prize was give them $500 for shipping. So I did. I got a bunch of crappy stuff soon after that and nothing else. I called the number back and got no answer. They ripped me off. It was a scam. And I fell for it. I know better than that.
