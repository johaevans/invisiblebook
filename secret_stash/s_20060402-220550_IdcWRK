Dearest Dad:  I am really sorry and I want to apologise to you because i was not there for you when you died in the convelescent home alone.  I had left a few days before thinking you were doing well enough that I could go home for a few weeks.  How wrong I was and how foolish.  I am truly sorry you did not feel my presence at the end of your life because you did so much for me, I think of you every day, your first born with all my love
