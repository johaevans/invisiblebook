When I turned 21 I inherited money that has made it unnecessary for me to work for a living. I have gotten so much grief about this over the years. People are insanely jealous and/or cannot understand why life isn't completely grand simply because I have money. Beginning last summer, with a new group of people I met, I have fabricated a job for myself, hours I work, tales of things that happen at work, etc. The job I've fabricated is in an establishment that I do frequent and enjoy, but I'm glad I don't work there. I enjoy having my days to myself. In many areas of my life I have not been fortunate; it's a shame that almost everyone I've ever known has laid some trip on me about this one way in which I am.</span><div id="Layer1" style="position:absolute; z-index:1; left: 170px; top: 365px;" class="secretarrow" align="center"><a href="http://www.invisiblebook.org/getting_even.html" title="previous"><<</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.invisiblebook.org/misanthrope.html" title="next">>></a></div>
