 

When I turned 21 I inherited money that has made it unnecessary for me to work for a living. I have gotten so much grief about this over the years. People are insanely jealous and/or cannot understand why life isn't completely grand simply because I have money. Beginning last summer, with a new group of people I met, I have fabricated a job for myself, hours I work, tales of things that happen at work, etc. The job I've fabricated is in an establishment that I do frequent and enjoy, but I'm glad I don't work there. I enjoy having my days to myself. In many areas of my life I have not been fortunate; it's a shame that almost everyone I've ever known has laid some trip on me about this one way in which I am.

I have a passion for anonymous sex in public places- parks, restrooms, parking lots, subways, etc... I am in a LTR w/someone I love, but the thrill and element of danger is something I crave, and seek out at least weekly since I was 15. I am now 39. I have had many close calls and have had some rather interesting ways of worming my way out of an arrest, which has only happened once. My partner would be heartbroken if he knew I did this.

I'm a misanthrope. I can't stand social engagements and will do anything I can to get out of them. People like me, though, because I figure if I get stuck at a stupid party then I should at least try to be entertaining. But I hate it. I make fun of people. I'm intolerant. I wish I had a truck full of cream pies to smash in people's faces.

I am in a new city looking for a job. I tell prospective employers that I quit my last job because I was going to relocate but that isn't true. I was fired so I decided to relocate to give me a better reason for finding a new job. 

Worst thing I ever did: Years ago I took a dog I didn't want anymore to the SPCA (she was untrainable) and said I found a stray. God's going to get me on that one. I still feel awful.

I'm a GWF. when i was 22 my brother (we're both adopted from different families) who was 20 at the time brutally raped me,i didn't tell anyone when it happened, because i knew what it would do to my parents. two months later i realized i was pregnant, i tried to tell my girlfriend, but she heard pregnant and thought i'd been fucking some random guy and wouldn't listen to anything i said and we broke up. i moved out and across the country. i was going to give the baby up for adoption but when the time came i couldn't. i have absolutely no contact with my brother and my mom thinks my son is the result of a turkey baster type insemination. she knows there is some HUGE problem between my brother and me, but my brother has always had big problems of one sort or another, addictions, can't keep a job, married five times, homeless for a long time, been in and out of jail, he's in jail right now for trying to kill my mom two years ago.my brother has no idea i have a kid.i haven't spoken to him since that day 14 years ago. i won't bring any of this up ever because it would hurt too many people.my son thinks his dad is someone i had a one night stand with. my son is perfectly happy with the family life we have now, i have been in a great,stable relationship with a wonderful woman for the last ten years, she is the only one that knows and i would trust her with my life.

Sometimes when another driver has pissed me off in traffic I've written down his/her license plate number and called the cops from a payphone and reported that I had seen the driver trying to lure a child into the car.

I worked a couple of dumb clerical temp jobs right after college. When paperwork would pile up I'd simply throw it all away. No one ever said a word.

when I was a kid, my school had a read-a-thon to raise money for some cause. People would sponsor you for the amount of books you read. I went all over the neighborhood getting people to pledge money. Then I read something like 30 books and I went out and collected the money. I told the school I read 12 books (average) and kept the rest of the money. However, I remember using part of it to buy my friends icecream, so there must have been some good in me.

I have a spotted dick. I mean it ï¿½ I have skin condition called vitiligo where the pigment lies in random spots. I hate it, and it has left me unable to have sex with anyone for the past 4 years. Not physically, but psychologically unable. 

I come across as exremely liberal, but I'm very sexist. My best friends wouldn't know it, but I really think women should be in the home.

 A few years ago I started taking opiate painkillers, and ended up seriously addicted when I found a constant supply. $10,000 and and a year later, I woke up, went through withdrawal (HELL), and quit taking them. To this day, I sometimes crave a Lortab or Oxycodone, and I've taken them a few times since, but I'll never let myself end up in the state I was in.

I've gone home with guys just to avoid a hotel bill. 

Here's one NOBODY knows. In HS, while everyone was dressed out of gym, I poured acid in the crotch of a bully's jeans. They slowly dissolved over the course of the day, and he had to leave school because of burns to his thighs and crotch. Don't fuck with the geeks.

When I was much younger, I stole money from the till at the store where I worked. I did it quite regularly justifying it by telling myself the 'old bastard' who owned the place wasn't paying me well enough. One day i did a rough calculation of how much 1'd taken and it was over $4000! In that moment I grew up more than ever before. I quit the job about two months later but for years I'd see my old employer on the street and he'd say how much he missed my work ethic. I feel sick thinking of this right now. And, you guessed it, the money was spent on booze and pot and pizzas.

I am a college professor and I find myself attracted to some of my male students (not just the jocks and frat guys, all types). Sometimes I give them better grades than they deserve, but never more than a move from a B- to a B or a C+ to a B-. Other than that, I grade very strictly. Perhaps as a result, I end up getting these guys in my class (and my office hours) term after term.

My mother's mother died when I was 17 and I hardly knew her so don't feel too bad about this. I have an imaginary "Gramma." She's always sending me things, and I am a completely doting grand-daughter. But every two years or so Gramma dies, and I have to take time off from work. My last employer even sent flowers.

My secret is that i am hopelessly in debt, earning buttons and i'm fucked if i know how to get out of this mess

My ex was fucking a bartender who was an illegal immigrant from Ireland. I reported him to INS and the bar owner to the IRS and never told my partner.

I binge eat like crazy. Some days when I feel alone, bored, or depressed, I'll go to the grocery store and buy junk food. Then come home and plop in front of the TV & computer and eat whole bags of candy, chips, have a pizza, popcorn, soda, whatever, until my stomach hurts. Sometimes I even feel sick enough and puke. But when I'm around people or out at a restaurant I eat normal, if not "picky". Luckily I exercise a lot so I stay fit and look like a picture of health.

I fathered a daughter at age 14. The girl was 18 at the time and told everyone she didn't know who the father was. Now my daughter is 23; I've seen her and she looks exactly like my sister. I'm aching inside to have contact but this girl was lucky enough to be adopted by her mother's husband at age 4 and by all accounts he was a great father. For years I've been waking up at night just realizing that I fathered another human being.

My secret is that I have breast cancer. I have told no one in my family. I have a type that is considered quite controversial in that many docs and studies are saying that women with this kind may never develop full blown, spreading cancer type. I hate pink ribbons, I hate pink teddy bears and all this pink crap that surrounds the disease. It is the new infantilization of women. I have decided to just wait it out and not take any action about it. I am already in my fifties and I am content to wait until the studies come out whether to do something or not. Meanwhile, no one knows about me having this. I even had the biopsy done and paid cash for it so it wouldn't show up on my medical records. Did it under an assumed name. Which can be done if you play your cards right.

I'm 36 years old and still a virgin. While I'm finally overcoming the hurts and fears that ruined my youth, I doubt I'll ever lose my virginity or find love. I'm too used to being alone, and who the hell wants to deflower a plain 36-year-old?

When I was 18 I went to cemetaries until I found the grave of a girl who would have been 21 had she lived (she died when she was 4). I went to the hall of records, got her birth certificate, went to DMV and took the complete driving test as her, with my photo, a friends fingerprint, all so I could drink with my older friends.

I need a really good cry but I am so emotionally corrupted I always feel the need to stop the tears before they come. I think I'm trash.

In general as I have grown older I have let the 'secrets' go and do not let them accummulate as there is no real need to do so. One of the perks of growing older is waking up to this realization.
