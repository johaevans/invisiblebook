My secret is that I have breast cancer. I have told no one in my family. I have a type that is considered quite controversial in that many docs and studies are saying that women with this kind may never develop full blown, spreading cancer type. I hate pink ribbons, I hate pink teddy bears and all this pink crap that surrounds the disease. It is the new infantilization of women. I have decided to just wait it out and not take any action about it. I am already in my fifties and I am content to wait until the studies come out whether to do something or not. Meanwhile, no one knows about me having this. I even had the biopsy done and paid cash for it so it wouldn't show up on my medical records. Did it under an assumed name. Which can be done if you play your cards right.</span><div id="Layer1" style="position:absolute; z-index:1; left: 170px; top: 365px;" class="secretarrow" align="center"><a href="http://www.invisiblebook.org/sexist_liberal.html" title="previous"><<</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.invisiblebook.org/waiting_form.html" title="next">>></a></div>
