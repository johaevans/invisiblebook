I'm a GWF. When I was 22 my brother (we're both adopted from different families) who was 20 at the time brutally raped me, I didn't tell anyone when it happened, because I knew what it would do to my parents. two months later I realized I was pregnant, I tried to tell my girlfriend, but she heard pregnant and thought I’d been fucking some random guy and wouldn't listen to anything I said and we broke up. I moved out and across the country. I was going to give the baby up for adoption but when the time came I couldn't. I have absolutely no contact with my brother and my mom thinks my son is the result of a turkey baster type insemination. she knows there is some HUGE problem between my brother and me, but my brother has always had big problems of one sort or another, addictions, can't keep a job, married five times, homeless for a long time, been in and out of jail, he's in jail right now for trying to kill my mom two years ago. My brother has no idea I have a kid. I haven't spoken to him since that day 14 years ago. I won't bring any of this up ever because it would hurt too many people. My son thinks his dad is someone I had a one night stand with. My son is perfectly happy with the family life we have now, I have been in a great, stable relationship with a wonderful woman for the last ten years, she is the only one that knows and I would trust her with my life.</span>
